          This mod lets you play as almost any NPC in the game. Not only can you
          pick and choose from almost the entire game's cast around 500
          characters - you can customise and change around 350 of them, flipping
          between body parts, accessories and more.

          You can’t talk about GTA 5 mods without paying respects to all the
          coders out there tirelessly attempting to make Los Santos look as
          breathtakingly beautiful as possible. There’s literally hundreds of
          graphics enhancement mods available for GTA 5, but NaturalVision
          Remastered is the current champion when it comes to raw “phwoar”
          power.

          “I am Iron Man” said Iron Man in Iron Man, and you can say it too if
          you install this forever popular mod on to your GTA 5 save. True to
          its word, the mod hooks you up with a fully operational Iron Man suit,
          complete with boost thrusters, repulsor beams, and that oh so
          satisfying “eeeeeyooooop” blaster sound that any Marvel fan will be
          familiar with.

          If Cyberpunk 2077 wasn't quite your thing, you can at least enjoy
          Grand Theft Auto 2013 by dressing it up in a neon aesthetic with this
          visual mod. Intensity ENB dials up the contrast between colours to 11,
          lending this ethereal, miasmic quality to Los Santos that’s drenched
          in atmosphere, especially when it also happens to be drenched in
          rainfall. The game’s lighting effects have been intensified too,
          meaning you’ll often feel like you’re in a J.J. Abrams movie just as
          much as a cyberpunk flick.

        <h2>Los Santos zombie apocalypse</h2>

          Simple Zombies turns GTA 5 into a mini survival sim, where players
          must survive an infested Los Santos by building shelters, managing
          their health and hunger, and recruiting fellow survivors littered
          throughout the zombie-filled landscape. It’s a fairly comprehensive
          game mode, and can be proper terrifying at times.

          They say the best way to defeat the enemy is to know the enemy, so why
          not sign up with the Los Santos Police Department and walk a mile in
          the shoes of a local cop for the day? There are detailed missions,
          police-themed weapons and vehicles, and customisation options for you
          to tuck into to get the full LSPD experience. Who knows, maybe you’ll
          end up preferring it your previous life of crime?
